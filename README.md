### An ECMAScript 5 only-compatible JavaScript library

The goal of this light-weight JavaScript library is to provide a nice, shorter and extended API using latest native compliant JavaScript and DOM APIs.
Taking advantage of amazing native speed, of course only in modern browsers, and no more adding extra bytes for older ones.

Give it a try and start using a robust, light-weight and modern library today.

## API Documentation
Please [visit the documentation](http://api.kimbojs.com) to see how easy is to use with its jQuery compatible API.

## Running the Unit Tests

Run grunt coffee task to compile `.coffee` spec files:
```bash
$ grunt coffee
```

And the open `test/SpecRunner.html` in your browser.

## Current status
The current version is the first release that even it works pritty well, is still under heavy development.
For now there isn't a browser compatibility table but have in mind it is intended for (and working) in modern mobile and desktop browsers.
