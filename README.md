### An ECMAScript 5 only-compatible JavaScript library

The goal of this light-weight JavaScript library is to provide a nice, shorter and extended API using latest native compliant JavaScript and DOM APIs.
Taking advantage of amazing native speed, of course only in modern browsers, and no more adding extra bytes for older ones.

Make the switch and start using a robust, light-weight and modern library today.

## Documentation
Please [visit the documentation](http://api.kimbojs.com) to see how easy is to use with its jQuery compatible API.

## Status
The current version is the first release that works really well, but still is under heavy development.
For now there isn't a browser compatibility table but have in mind it is intended to work perfectly in modern browsers.
